# What is this workshop about?

A talk about web performance, how to measure it and how to know if things work as fast as possible.

Since this topic is really really broad, in this session we are going to focus on something most of us have already heard but probably didn't worked with. The FPS (Frames Per second) and how elements are rendered in our browsers.
